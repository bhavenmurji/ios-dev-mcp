# Outreach Templates for MCP Authors

## Template 1: Initial Contact (Collaboration Proposal)

**Subject:** Collaborating on Unified iOS Development MCP

Hi [Author Name],

I'm Bhaven, a Family Medicine resident and healthcare AI founder building Ignite Health Systems. I've been impressed by your work on [Project Name] - it's exactly the kind of tool the iOS/Claude community needs.

**The Opportunity:**
I've noticed there are now 4+ separate iOS/Xcode MCPs (including yours), each solving different parts of the development workflow:
- SwiftClaude (Swift execution)
- ios-simulator-mcp (UI automation)  
- XcodeBuildMCP (building)
- xcode-mcp-server (comprehensive tools)

**The Problem:**
Users have to juggle multiple MCPs and lose Claude's context switching between them. There's no single tool that enables true conversational development from code → build → test → debug.

**The Proposal:**
I'd love to collaborate on creating a unified, open-source iOS Development MCP that consolidates the best of all these projects. This would:

✅ Give users one seamless tool instead of 4 fragmented ones
✅ Establish a community standard (like how prettier/eslint became defaults)
✅ Pool our efforts for faster iteration and better quality
✅ Credit all contributors prominently
✅ Build something that becomes the de facto iOS MCP

**What I'm Thinking:**
- MIT/Apache license (fully open source)
- Modular architecture so users can enable just what they need
- Credit all original authors prominently in README and releases
- Collaborative decision-making on roadmap
- Could maintain your current project too if you prefer

**My Background:**
- Medical background with strong technical interests
- Building healthcare AI startup (experience shipping products)
- Active in open source community
- Looking to contribute meaningfully to iOS dev tools

Would you be interested in chatting about this? I'm flexible on structure - could be anything from merging efforts to cross-linking projects to something entirely different.

Happy to jump on a quick call or keep it async over GitHub/email.

Best,
Bhaven

## Template 2: Follow-up (If No Response After 1 Week)

**Subject:** Re: Collaborating on Unified iOS Development MCP

Hi [Author Name],

Following up on my previous email about potentially collaborating on a unified iOS MCP.

I completely understand if you're busy or prefer to keep [Project Name] independent. Either way, I wanted to share that I'm moving forward with creating an open-source unified tool and would love to:

1. **Credit your work** - Your [specific feature] implementation is excellent and I'd like to acknowledge it
2. **Avoid duplication** - If there's a better approach than what you've built, I'd rather learn from you than reinvent
3. **Cross-promote** - Happy to link to your project and recommend it for [specific use case]

No pressure at all - just wanted to loop back and see if you had any thoughts or preferences.

Thanks for the great work on [Project Name]!

Best,
Bhaven

## Template 3: If They're Interested

**Subject:** Re: Collaborating on Unified iOS Development MCP - Next Steps

Hi [Author Name],

Awesome! Really excited to collaborate. Here's what I'm thinking for next steps:

**Immediate (This Week):**
1. Set up GitHub repo with basic structure
2. Draft initial architecture document
3. Schedule quick sync call to align on vision

**Short Term (Next 2-4 Weeks):**
1. Decide on tool architecture (TypeScript vs Swift vs hybrid)
2. Create MVP with core features from our existing projects
3. Document contribution guidelines
4. Set up testing framework

**My Proposal for Structure:**
- Collaborative maintainership (all authors get commit access)
- Decisions by consensus when possible
- Regular (monthly?) sync calls
- Discord/Slack for async discussion

**What I Can Contribute:**
- Project management and coordination
- Documentation and community building
- Testing infrastructure
- User feedback loops (I have access to medical/startup communities)

**Questions for You:**
1. What would you most want to work on?
2. Any deal-breakers or must-haves for the project?
3. Preferred communication style (async vs calls)?
4. Timeline constraints on your end?

Let me know what works for you!

Best,
Bhaven

## Template 4: For Community Announcement (Once Project Starts)

**Subject:** [New Project] Unified iOS Development MCP - Looking for Contributors

Hi iOS/Claude Community,

We're excited to announce a new open-source project: **iOS Development MCP** - a unified tool that brings together Swift execution, Xcode building, simulator control, and testing into one seamless experience with Claude.

**Why This Matters:**
Currently, iOS developers using Claude need to juggle 4+ different MCP servers, losing context and breaking workflow. This project consolidates the best features from existing tools into one cohesive experience.

**What We're Building:**
- Swift code execution and experimentation
- Xcode project building and management
- iOS Simulator control and UI automation
- Real device testing support
- Visual regression testing
- CI/CD integrations

**Built on Great Work:**
This project stands on the shoulders of giants and consolidates features from:
- SwiftClaude by @GeorgeLyon
- ios-simulator-mcp by @joshuayoes  
- XcodeBuildMCP by @cameroncooke
- xcode-mcp-server by @r-huijts

**How to Get Involved:**
🌟 Star the repo: [GitHub link]
💬 Join discussions: [Discussions link]
🐛 Report issues: [Issues link]
🛠️ Contribute: See CONTRIBUTING.md

**We're Looking For:**
- Swift/TypeScript developers
- iOS automation experts
- Technical writers
- Beta testers

Let's build the future of iOS development with Claude together!

Best,
[Maintainers]

## Notes for Outreach Strategy

**Priority Order:**
1. **GeorgeLyon** (SwiftClaude) - Most mature Swift execution, could be foundation
2. **r-huijts** (xcode-mcp-server) - Most comprehensive, already thinking holistically
3. **cameroncooke** (XcodeBuildMCP) - Clean build implementation
4. **joshuayoes** (ios-simulator-mcp) - UI automation expertise

**Timing:**
- Send all emails same day (Thursday/Friday to give weekend thinking time)
- Follow up Tuesday if no response by Monday
- If 2+ authors interested, schedule group call
- If everyone passes, build solo but maintain credit/acknowledgment

**Tone:**
- Respectful of their existing work
- Collaborative not competitive
- Clear benefits (users, community, credibility)
- Low pressure, high opportunity
- Professional but friendly

**What to Avoid:**
- Don't position as "your project has problems"
- Don't promise specific timelines
- Don't overcomplicate governance upfront
- Don't undersell your own capabilities
